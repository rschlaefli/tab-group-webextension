<h1>Heuristics Status: Already Running</h1>

If the heuristics fails with the code ALREADY_RUNNING, there might be an orphaned instance running
in the background. We only allow running one instance at a time (e.g., only having it enabled in
Firefox OR Chrome). To fix this issue, open a task or process manager and end the process related to
our heuristics backend (i.e., the respective JVM), then try enabling the heuristics again.

<h2>Linux (Ubuntu)</h2>

Open "System Monitor" and end the "java" process that is running in ~/bin/tabs/bin (the installation
directory).

<h2>Windows</h2>

Open Task Manager using X. Close the process called "Adopt..." by right-clicking and selecting "X".
