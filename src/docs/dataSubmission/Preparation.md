# Preparation

To make the entire review process easier and more efficient, we have created a tool that applies some initial transformations to your locally stored data (e.g., combines everything into few files with descriptive headers). You can download the latest version of the tool from the following links:

Windows: X.exe
MacOS: X
Linux: X

_Might remove this:_ Alternatively, if you are familiar with Python and want to evaluate/tune the code of our script, we recommend that you download the latest version of the tool from <https://tabs.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/submission/data_helper.py> and run it from the command line ...

Using the latest version of the review toolkit, run the `prepare` command to generate a folder for `tabs_submission` in your home directory. This folder will contain all of the prepared, cleaned, and packaged/encrypted data that are generated for submission.
