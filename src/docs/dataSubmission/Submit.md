# Submit

Once you have gone through the cleanup process, we suggest that you have a final look at the data files in the `tabs_submission/cleaned` directory in your user home. These files are exactly what will be packaged and encrypted in this final step (nothing outside of this directory will be shared).

When you are satisfied with the data you are about to share, run the `package` command to create an encrypted package of your data. The toolkit will encrypt your data using a unique key that you can then share with us alongside the data package.

We encourage you to share the data package and encryption key over separate channels, thereby making sure that no unauthorized party will be able to access your data. For example, you could use a cloud provider like [UZH Dropfiles](https://dropfiles.uzh.ch) to upload and share your encrypted data package, and any other means of direct communication to share the encryption key (e.g., email to `roland.schlaefli@uzh.ch`).

We will notify you once we have successfully downloaded and opened the data. Please do not delete any data before you have gotten such an acknowledgement.
