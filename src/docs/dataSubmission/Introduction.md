# Data Submission

First of all, thanks for your participation in our user study!

To allow us to analyze the data collected during the study and to potentially draw interesting conclusions, we now ask you to review and submit the data that has been collected and stored on your local computer.

To aid in that process, we have developed a toolkit that allows you to easily purge unwanted parts from all data files at once (among other tasks). The next steps will guide you through the data review and submission process with the aid of our toolkit.
