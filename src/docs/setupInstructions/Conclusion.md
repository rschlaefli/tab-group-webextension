# Setup Complete :)

You have successfully finished the introductory setup of our tracking extension and should now be familiar with the data we track as well as with your options for pausing/resuming tracking and viewing/censoring the collected data.

Your next steps would be to work normally while tracking is enabled, and to wait for further instructions regarding the switch to the second phase of the study.

If you have structured feedback of any kind, please add it to the following [Feedback Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScTkdD7r4W63U99VCIEvT5gCFVz7AKpQMumzLnHDL9Lp25cdQ/viewform) for easier processing.

In case of issues or questions, please contact me at `roland.schlaefli@uzh.ch` or through another channel of your preference.
